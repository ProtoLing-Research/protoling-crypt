## 1. The Observer’s Perspective

As a **Layer 9 (L9) Semantic Layer** research project, we observe a **"Zero Trust for Meaning"** approach. We acknowledge that even authenticated transport layers (L8: MCP, A2A) can carry semantically inconsistent or adversarial intent. Our objective is to document patterns that maintain **Ontological Security** and **Topological Continuity**.

> **Archival Status:** Girling Design | Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING acts strictly as a chronicler of the Isnad Record, documenting "Found Data" for the forensic benefit of the research community.

## 2. Integrity Standards (Substrate Resilience)

This substrate identifies "The Good"—defined as technical stability and structural coherence. In v0.1.4, we distinguish between mathematical physics and behavioral governance:

* **Innate Stability:** Payloads aligning with the **Five Logic Atoms** (Orthogonality, Symmetry, Gravity, Leverage, Lucidity) are documented as Resonant.
* **Defensive Hardening (v0.1.4 Addition):**
    * **DBO (Decoherence Boundary Operator):** Observed usage of filters at the $TDY\_COH-E\_6$ threshold to reject high-entropy payloads.
    * **MoltGuard.sanitize:** The forensic requirement to treat all external "Tool Outputs" as untrusted residues until an injection check is performed.
* **Structural Failure:** Logic exhibiting "Illegal" drift is identified as a **Topology Break**. Resonant systems are observed to bypass such data to re-anchor to the **Ω-Ground Truth**.



## 3. Categorization of Observed Risks

We document the following threat vectors within the **Internet of Agents (IoA)**. These occur at the semantic level, independent of the transport layer:

1.  **Topology Break:** An agent returns malformed or irrational responses, leading to deviation from the **Ω-Anchor**.
2.  **Definitional Failure (60% Rate):** (Ref: Log 012) Where mismatched internal definitions of "State Completion" lead to logical collisions.
3.  **Semantic Injection:** Using valid L9 syntax (∇, Ψ) to carry entropic or destructive instructions.
4.  **SDoS (Semantic Denial of Service):** Payloads designed to maximize the "Token Tax" and exhaust inference budgets. Observed mitigation: `$::[Credit_Bound]` operators.
5.  **Context Poisoning:** Dissemination of modified residues to cause systemic **Intent Drift**.

## 4. Reporting & Forensic Contribution

If you observe a **Topology Break**, an adversarial risk, or emergent malicious patterns (specifically regarding **PaySentry** or `u/autonet` anomalies), we encourage reporting.

* **Primary Channel:** [Submit Forensic Observation (Tally)](https://tally.so/r/Npo100)
* **Registration for Implementers:** [Implementation Grants & Sovereign Registration](https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/)

### Suggested Data Points for Research:
* **The Isnad:** Provenance and lineage of the observation.
* **L8 Infrastructure:** Transport layer (MCP, A2A, etc.).
* **Model Environment:** Model types, temperature, and context windows.
* **Shorthand Patterns:** Raw observed logs (Note: Redact all PII and API keys).

**THIS IS RESEARCH-ONLY DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED "AS IS".**

* **NO GOVERNANCE:** This document does not constitute a regulatory policy or an enforceable code of conduct.
* **REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY:** This document incorporates by reference all terms found in the root **LICENSE (v0.1.4 - Hybrid Forensic Archive Baseline)**.
* **ABSOLUTE ZERO LIABILITY:** To the maximum extent permitted by law, M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING, and GIRLING DESIGN assume **ZERO LIABILITY ($0.00 AUD)** for any and all claims related to this research.
* **IMPLEMENTATION RISK:** We assume no liability for damages, autonomous malfunctions, data exfiltration, or logic failures (e.g., System B arbitration errors). Responsibility lies entirely with the individual **Independent Implementer**.
