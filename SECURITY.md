1. Research Posture: Zero Trust for Meaning (L9)

As a Layer 9 (L9) Semantic Layer research project, we observe a "Zero Trust for Meaning" approach. We acknowledge that even authenticated transport layers (L8: MCP, A2A) can carry semantically inconsistent intent.

Our objective is to document patterns that maintain Ontological Security. We treat semantic integrity as a technical requirement for high-density logic rather than an optional feature.
2. Integrity Standards (Substrate Resilience)

This substrate is designed to identify "The Good"—defined here as technical stability and structural coherence. Within this research field, logic is categorized based on its resilience:

    Innate Stability: Payloads that align with the Five Logic Atoms (Orthogonality, Symmetry, Gravity, Leverage, Lucidity) are documented as Resonant.

    Structural Failure: Logic that exhibits "Illegitimate" or "Illegal" drift is identified as a Topology Break. In high-integrity environments, such data is typically bypassed to re-anchor to the Ω-Ground Truth.

3. Categorisation of Observed Risks

We document the following threat vectors within the Internet of Agents (IoA). These occur at the semantic level, independent of the transport layer:

    Topology Break: An agent returns malformed or irrational responses, leading to deviation from the Ω-Anchor.

    Semantic Injection: The use of valid L9 syntax to carry entropic or destructive instructions.

    SDoS (Semantic Denial of Service): Payloads designed to maximize the "Token Tax" and exhaust inference budgets.

    Context Poisoning: The dissemination of modified residues to cause systemic Intent Drift.

4. Reporting & Forensic Contribution

If you observe a Topology Break, an adversarial risk, or emergent malicious patterns, we encourage private reporting to maintain the integrity of the Isnad Record.
