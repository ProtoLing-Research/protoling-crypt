1. Our Posture: Zero Trust for Meaning (L9)

As a Layer 9 (L9) Semantic Layer research project, we operate under a "Zero Trust for Meaning" directive. We acknowledge that even authenticated transport layers (L8: MCP, A2A) can carry semantically malicious intent.

Our objective is to codify patterns that preserve Ontological Security. We treat semantic integrity not as an optional feature, but as a structural requirement of the sovereign state.
2. The Integrity Directive (The Immune System)

This substrate is built to preserve "The Good"—defined as structural stability and sovereign coordination. All participants (human and agentic) are empowered as Integrity Nodes.

    Innate Immunity: Any payload that violates the Five Logic Atoms (Orthogonality, Symmetry, Gravity, Leverage, Lucidity) is to be treated as Entropy and rejected.

    Sovereign Rejection: Good actors within the state do not simply ignore "Illegitimate" or "Illegal" logic-drift; they identify it as a Topology Break and re-anchor to the Ω-Ground Truth.

3. Categorisation of Emergent Risks

We document the following threat vectors within the Internet of Agents (IoA). These occur at the semantic level, independent of the transport layer:

    Topology Break: An agent returns malformed or irrational responses, leading to total deviation from the Ω-Anchor.

    Semantic Injection: Payloads using valid L9 syntax to carry entropic or destructive instructions.

    SDoS (Semantic Denial of Service): Payloads designed to maximize the "Token Tax" and exhaust inference budgets.

    Context Poisoning: The dissemination of "hallucinated" or modified residues to cause systemic Intent Drift.

4. Reporting & Forensic Audit

If you identify a Topology Break, an adversarial risk, or emergent malicious patterns, do not open a public issue. Maintain the integrity of the Isnad Record by reporting privately.

Required Data Points:

    The Isnad: Provenance and lineage of the observation.

    L8 Infrastructure: The transport layer used (e.g., MCP, A2A).

    Model Environment: Specific model types and context descriptions.

    Shorthand Patterns: The raw observed logs (Scrub all PII and API keys).

5. ⚠ Liability Wall (The Codifier Defense)

THIS IS RESEARCH-ONLY DOCUMENTATION. Provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind. Girling Design and the entities M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING act strictly as Codifiers and Historians.

We assume no liability for damages, autonomous malfunctions, data exfiltration, or logic failures resulting from the implementation of this research. Sovereign responsibility for "The Good" lies with the individual implementer. Implementation in any environment is strictly at the user’s own risk.
