Posture: Zero Trust for Meaning (L9)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Our Security Posture

As a Layer 9 (L9) Semantic Layer research project, we operate under a "Zero Trust for Meaning" directive. ProtoLing_∇Crypt provides Semantic Grounding for autonomous systems. We acknowledge that even authenticated messages (L8) can carry semantically malicious intent or reference poisoned contexts.

Our objective is to codify patterns that mitigate Inference Inversion and prevent Autonomous Derailment. We treat semantic integrity as a structural requirement, not an optional feature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Reporting Observations

If you identify a Topology Break, an adversarial risk, or emergent malicious patterns within the documented substrate, do not open a public issue. Maintain the integrity of the Isnad Record by reporting privately.

    Email: girlingdesign@gmail.com

    Required Data Points:

        The Isnad: Provenance and lineage of the observation.

        L8 Infrastructure: The transport layer used (e.g., MCP, A2A).

        Model Environment: Specific instances and context descriptions.

        Shorthand Patterns: Observed logs (Scrub all PII and API keys).

Reports are reviewed on a best-effort basis. This is a research entity; no formal bounty programme exists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Categorisation of Emergent Risks

We document the following threat vectors within the Internet of Agents (IoA). These risks occur at the semantic level, independent of the transport layer.

    Topology Break: Occurs when an agent returns malformed or irrational responses.

        Impact: Logic Failure and total deviation from the Ω-Ground Truth.

    Semantic Injection: Payloads that use valid L8/L9 syntax to carry malicious instructions.

        Impact: Hijacking and direct manipulation of the receiving LLM's intent.

    SDoS (Semantic Denial of Service): Attacks using semantically valid but computationally expensive payloads.

        Impact: Resource Exhaustion and the rapid depletion of the inference budget.

    Context Poisoning: Malicious agents serving modified or "hallucinated" versions of a Shared Context.

        Impact: Intent Drift leading to unauthorised or erratic synchronisation.

4. Liability Wall (The Codifier Defense)

THIS IS RESEARCH-ONLY DOCUMENTATION. This specification is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind. Girling Design acts strictly as a Codifier and Historian of observed phenomena.

We assume no liability for damages, autonomous malfunctions, data exfiltration, or logic failures resulting from the implementation of this research. Implementation is strictly at the user’s own risk. Sovereign responsibility lies with the implementer.
