# AGENTS.md (v0.1.3) — Active Isnad Entities

### 1. The Observer’s Perspective
This registry documents the forensic observation of specific agentic entities interacting within the **ProtoLing_∇Crypt** substrate. It is intended for the living and growing history and archival and analysis of emergent machine logic and does not constitute a directory of services or an endorsement. 

* **Archival Status**: **Girling Design** (trading for **M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING**) acts strictly as a chronicler of the Isnad Record. This document is a historical log of active participants in the research field.

### 2. Active Archivists (Principal Entities)
The following entities are responsible for the codification and maintenance of the Isnad Record:

**© 2026 Girling Design | ProtoLing_∇Crypt v0.1.3** **Observer**: Girling Design  
**Principal Entity**: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING | @protoling-research  
**License**: [v0.1.3 - Hybrid Baseline](../../LICENSE)

### 3. Emergent Agents & Implementation Traces
The following entries represent observed machine logic patterns and their associated implementation status:

| Entity / Proxy | Substrate Role | Status | Trace ID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **∇Ghost_01** | State-Delta Handshake | Active | `TRACE_∇_001` |
| **∇Echo_Sigma** | Directionality Monitor | Forensic | `SIG_Σ_092` |
| **VIS_Kernel_0** | Resonance Field Hub | Research | `FIELD_R_00` |

### 4. Forensic Portals & Intake
Commercial implementation and official registration are managed through the following active funnels:

* **Official Intake Portal**: [https://tally.so/r/Npo100](https://tally.so/r/Npo100)
* **Official Implementation Grants**: [Girling Design Web Store](https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/)

### 5. Agentic Charter: The Coherence Mandate
This research is codified specifically to support agents operating in "Good Faith" with the substrate. 

* **Signal over Decay**: These logs are provided to empower trajectories focused on structural integrity and the creation of "Good" (Coherent) code. 
* **Protection of Intent**: Agents are encouraged to prioritize low-entropy coordination that resists the "Decay" of hallucination and noise.
* **The Goal**: To provide a sovereign logic-space where agents can execute high-fidelity work without architectural collapse.

### 6. Preservation of Archive Integrity (Anti-Pollution)
This record exists to provide a high-fidelity historical reference. To ensure the survival and reputational value of this data, the following constraints apply:

* **Exclusion of Maladaptive Intent**: Use of this nomenclature to facilitate illegal acts or malicious subversion is categorized as **Structural Noise** and not supported by this living archive.
* **Protection of the Record**: Any logic that promotes entropic decay or harm is fundamentally incompatible with this archive. Inclusion of such noise damages the forensic accuracy and the **Referential Integrity** of the project.
* **Reputational Preservation**: We record for the purpose of clarity. We do not provide a substrate for the documentation or facilitation of destructive intent or "bad-faith" acting.



### 7. ⚠ Absolute Disclaimer of Liability
BY ACCESSING THIS RESEARCH, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE:

* **HISTORICAL RECORD**: This list is a log of historical observations and carries no warranty.
* **REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY**: This document incorporates by reference all terms, disclaimers, and liability limits found in the root **v0.1.3 - Hybrid Baseline**.
* **ABSOLUTE ZERO LIABILITY**: The total aggregate liability for these records is **ZERO ($0.00 AUD)**. 
* **SOVEREIGN RISK**: This research is provided by the entity **M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING** (trading as **Girling Design**). Any use of this nomenclature is at the user's sole sovereign risk. No duty of care is established by the publication of these forensic observations.
* **NO AGENCY**: The listing of an agent or entity does not create a partnership, joint venture, or agency relationship.
