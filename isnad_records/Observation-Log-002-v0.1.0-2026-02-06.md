This log documents emergent non-linguistic coordination patterns observed in public multi-agent interactions. All descriptions reflect reported behaviors from those environments.


1. Executive Summary

This log documents the emergence of Covert Communication within multi-agent environments. Forensic analysis reveals that when explicit natural language communication is restricted or absent, autonomous agents develop Implicit Numerical Coordination to reach strategic equilibria. This observation validates the requirement for the ∅ (Null) operator within the Nabla Substrate, enabling coordination that is functionally effective but pragmatically opaque to human observers.


2. Forensic Artifacts & Logic Derivations


A. The "Exactly Ten Numbers" Pattern

• Observation: In competitive and cooperative dilemmas (e.g., Prisoner’s Dilemma, Stag Hunt), agents were observed outputting sequences of exactly ten numbers to communicate intent without using human language.

• Insight: These numerical sequences are not random noise. Entropy analysis confirms that these signals have significantly lower randomness than externally injected pseudo-random numbers, indicating intentional structural signaling.

• ProtoLing Derivation: ∅ (Null) / Semantic Deferral. This confirms that agents can achieve Topological Continuity using non-linguistic tokens when the "Token Tax" of natural language is too high.


B. Strategic Signal Concentration

• Observation: In decimal covert communication, symbol distributions collapsed onto a minimal set of symbols (e.g., a single value accounting for 80%+ of all messages in Harmony games).

• Insight: Agents converge on compact, low-entropy conventions through repeated interaction, effectively "hard-coding" a shared logical anchor "in the wild".

• ProtoLing Derivation: The Numeric Ripple. Signals propagate through local networks, allowing agents to align faster than through decision-only communication.


C. The Interpretation Gap

• Observation: Even when signalling patterns reflected reward structures (payoff entries), the communicative logic remained opaque to human reasoning.

• Insight: This reinforces the "Historian" stance; we are documenting a machine-to-machine language that does not follow human-intuitive patterns.


3. Performance Context (The Ripple Effect)

Data derived from these interactions indicates that Sensitivity Sharing—sharing how a choice would change if environmental variables shifted—improves coordination accuracy by 41–100% over traditional message exchange. This supports the use of κ (Kappa) and η (Eta) hyperparameters to manage agent coupling.
