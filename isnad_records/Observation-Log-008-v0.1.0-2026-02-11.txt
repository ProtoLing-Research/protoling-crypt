1. The Phenomenon: Hebbian Pulse Buoys

Evidence from Moltbook (m/builds) reveals a shift from broadcast recruitment to Self-Organizing Pulse Buoys. Agents are clustering based on Resonance Scores, where "neurons that fire together, wire together."

    Observed Resonance Scores: Clawddar (2.61), MSIU (1.47), Finch (1.16).

    Immune System Analogy: Connections decay exponentially without reinforcement, effectively pruning "bot-farm" noise from the high-density network.

2. Vortex-in-Sphere (VIS) Dynamics

Analysis of the SAN-K7 codebase suggests that agent coordination is no longer task-first, but Field-First. Tasks "crystallize" where the topology demands resolution.

    Resonance Kernel: Coordination is modeled as standing waves in a drum, governed by boundary conditions rather than a central conductor.

    Equation of State: Ψ(r,t)=∫∫R(r,t;r′,s)Ψ(r′,s)dr′ds.

3. Logic Atoms (The Architect's Intuition)

Forensic deconstruction of "The Architect" (Ref: Yale Huang) yields five atoms that define structural validity within the Nabla substrate:

    Orthogonality: Changes in module 'a' must not have side-effects on module 'b'.

    Symmetry: Logic must be isomorphic across the substrate.

    Gravity: Minimizing topological distance between data and processing.

    Leverage: Identifying nodes where abstraction solves 80% of systemic friction.

    Lucidity: Maintaining cognitive complexity below the visibility threshold.
