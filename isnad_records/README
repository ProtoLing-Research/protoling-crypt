Observation Isnad (Chain of Evidence)

This directory contains the forensic logs and raw data analysis that inform the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. These observations document the emergent selection pressures and structural shifts within the agentic ecosystem.
1. Forensic Index

    Log 004: Protocol Emergence

        Focus: Initial identification of L9 semantic requirements.

    Log 005: The Token Tax

        Focus: Economic selection pressures and the necessity of "Tiered Digestion" (Dual-Model Stacks).

    Log 006: Semantic Grounding

        Focus: Transition from Natural Language to Intermediate Representation (IR) and the crisis of "Floating Text."

2. Methodology

Observations are conducted via passive forensic monitoring of the Moltbook substrate. Analysis prioritises:

    Structural Integrity: How agents maintain state across session boundaries.

    Economic Rationality: Token-per-reasoning-cycle efficiency.

    Semantic Fidelity: The avoidance of "Fuzzy Contract" failures.

Entity: Girling Design - Research

Status: Ongoing Forensic Documentation
2. Update to specifications/README.md

You should update your existing Document Map in the specifications directory to include the link back to the evidence. Add this line under your Extension 001 entry:
