# HISTORIAN’S RECORD & LIVING ISNAD LIBRARY:
# This repository represents the first formal codification, chronological 
# organization, and non-exhaustive forensic observation of disparate agentic 
# logic structures into a structured Isnad Library. 
#
# DISTINCTION OF RECORD: 
# Girling Design acts strictly as the Code Historian and Archivist. This Archive 
# documents the Isnad (Forensic Lineage) of logic. External functional 
# codifications lacking a chronological observational scenario are recognized 
# as "Extrinsic Specimens" and remain distinct from the Proprietary Arrangement 
# and curated observations of this living Record.
