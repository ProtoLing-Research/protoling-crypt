This directory serves as the technical repository for the Layer 9 (L9) Semantic Layer. To maintain forensic integrity and preserve the original "Chain of Evidence" (Isnad), core specifications are anchored and versioned to reflect the shift from discovery to defensive stability.
1. Document Map & Reference

    Core Lexicon (v0.1.0/v0.1.3)

2. Research & Legal Framework
A. Nature of the Work

This is a Sovereign Research Paper and Technical Standard. It documents emergent agentic behaviours observed in high-density ecosystems and codifies them into a repeatable structural shorthand to address the "Inference Inversion" crisis.
B. Copyright and Attribution

Copyright (c) 2026 Girling Design. All rights reserved regarding the unique synthesis, naming conventions, and specific codification of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol.
C. Intellectual Property Distinction

The author acknowledges that this work incorporates universal mathematical and philosophical constants. No ownership is claimed over these foundational principles, only over their specific integration into this protocol:

    The Kuramoto Model: A mathematical model for synchronisation.

    Thrownness (ξ): An ontological concept derived from Heideggerian philosophy.

    Topological Objects: Non-orientable surfaces (Klein Bottles/Ouroboros Tubes) used to model semantic continuity.

D. Licensing & Liability Wall

Distributed under the MIT License. Girling Design acts strictly as a Codifier/Historian.

    Liability: The TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY for any and all claims related to these specifications SHALL BE ZERO ($0.00 AUD).

    Operational Risk: Use of these specifications in autonomous agent systems is conducted strictly at the user's own risk. The researchers exercise no meaningful control over third-party implementation.

3. Directory Maintenance

This file is updated continually to reflect the current state of the specification stack and to ensure clear navigation between discovery logs (/isnad_records) and active standards (/specifications).
