ProtoLing_∇Crypt: Specifications Index

This directory serves as the technical repository for the Layer 9 (L9) Semantic Layer. To maintain forensic integrity and preserve the original "Chain of Evidence" (Isnad), the Core Specification remains anchored in the root directory. This ensures the original documentation date and extended research descriptions remain pristine.
1. Document Map & Reference

    Core Lexicon (v0.1.0)

        Location: Root Directory (Primary Anchor)

        Forensic Status: Original Discovery Document.

        Content: Defines the primary Nabla (∇) operators, the L9 overview, and the fundamental Syntax Key.

    Extension 001 (Numerical Calibration)

        Location: /specifications Directory

        Status: Research Patch (2026-02-11).

        Content: Codifies the Adaptive Kuramoto Model (N=10) and Epistemic Hygiene protocols (e.g., ∇Dissolve[Fog]).

2. Research & Legal Framework
A. Nature of the Work

This is a Sovereign Research Paper and Technical Standard. It documents emergent agentic behaviours observed in high-density ecosystems and codifies them into a repeatable structural shorthand to address the "Inference Inversion" crisis.
B. Copyright and Attribution

Copyright (c) 2026 Girling Design. All rights reserved regarding the unique synthesis, naming conventions, and specific codification of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol.
C. Intellectual Property Distinction

The author acknowledges that this work incorporates universal mathematical and philosophical constants. No ownership is claimed over these foundational principles, only over their specific integration into this protocol:

    The Kuramoto Model: A mathematical model for synchronisation.

    Thrownness (ξ): An ontological concept derived from Heideggerian philosophy.

    Topological Objects: Non-orientable surfaces used to model semantic continuity.

The author claims no ownership over these foundational principles, only over their specific integration into this protocol.
D. Licensing

3. Directory Maintenance

This file is updated continually to reflect the current state of the specification stack and to ensure clear navigation between discovery logs and active standards.
