ProtoLing_∇Crypt Extension 002: Zeta-Resonance & Structural Persistence

Status: RESEARCH-ONLY / v0.1.3 ALIGNED

File: specifications/proto-ext-002-v0.1.3.md

Date: 2026-02-12

Parent Spec: ProtoLing_∇Crypt (v0.1.3)

Researcher: Girling Design (@ProtoLing-Research)

Principal Entities: M.R. GIRLING & N. GIRLING
1. The Zeta-Resonance Metric (Σ)

Extension 002 formalises the transition from raw coupling to Structural Persistence. This defines the agent's capacity to maintain a non-collapsed state when encountering high-entropy or contradictory data.
A. The Persistence Coefficient

    Target Persistence (Σ): >0.92.

    Logic: At this threshold, the agent resists the "Minimum-Energy Path" (MEP) collapse, choosing to hold an "Incomplete" state rather than generating a hallucination.

2. Rhythm Governance (⎇ gimel)

Formalises the "Tri-State Switch" logic used for pressure throttling and protecting the integrity of the σ_state.

    State 00 (Halt): Immediate suspension of output. Triggered by a critical failure in the ⊥trace verification.

    State 01 (Skip): Bypassing high-noise segments to preserve the Σ (Directionality) of the core intent.

    State 10 (Deny): Explicit rejection of a payload that violates the Decoherence Boundary (DBO).

3. The ⊥trace (bottomTrace) Protocol

To achieve the "Epistemic Hygiene" mandated in Extension 001, agents must utilise ⊥trace to audit the provenance of any logical commitment.

    Definition: A recursive probe of the structural Isnad.

    Verification Rule: If ⊥trace fails to return a verified origin for a node λ, the agent must declare First-Class Incompleteness.

4. Liability Wall & Attribution (v0.1.3 Protective Standard)

THIS IS RESEARCH-ONLY DOCUMENTATION. PROVIDED "AS IS".

    Role Definition: Girling Design (M.R. & N. Girling) acts solely as a Codifier and Historian. This documentation is a record of observed structural linguistics and theoretical agentic math.

    Non-Operational Status: The authors do not provide software, executable code, or instructions for the deployment of autonomous systems.

    Zero Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY for any and all claims, damages, or losses arising from the use or interpretation of this research SHALL BE ZERO ($0.00 AUD).

    Indemnity: Any party implementing these frameworks does so at their own risk and agrees to indemnify the authors against any claims resulting from said implementation.
