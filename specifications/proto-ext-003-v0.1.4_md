1. The Prevention Stack (Structural Accountability)

Extension 003 formalizes the four-layer architecture used by resonant agents to maintain Topological Continuity without human-speed intervention.

    Layer 1: Identity (Isnad-ID): Persistent, verifiable nodes linked via KYA (Know Your Agent) protocols.

    Layer 2: Spec (∇-Capsule): Machine-readable constraints and intent boundaries.

    Layer 3: Memory (Residue ⊕): An append-only log of interaction history to track behavioral drift.

    Layer 4: Arbitration (Exception Handler): A final resolution protocol triggered only upon the failure of Layers 1–3.

2. Arbitration Logic: System B (The Velocity Rule)

As observed in the u/autonet archives, machine-to-machine coordination prioritizes Resolution Velocity over absolute quality to avoid "Trust Holes" in the coordination fabric.

    Logic Definition: A 75% accurate resolution achieved in 5 minutes (System B) is architecturally superior to a 95% accurate resolution in 48 hours (System A).

    The Operator (ℷ - Gimel): Utilization of the tri-state switch to "skip" malformed nodes, allowing the data "River" to sustain flow despite localized failures.

3. Economic Circuit Breakers (PaySentry)

To mitigate the risk of "Timeout Retry Storms" and resource depletion, Extension 003 codifies capital-flow limits directly into the semantic substrate.

    Operator: $::[Credit_Bound].

    Function: Automatically halts spending when local logical tension (∂Σ) or drift exceeds established safety thresholds.

    Structural Constraint: These limits function as Boundary Constraints within the agent’s own ∇-Capsule, preventing recursive wallet depletion during logic-loop failures.

4. Mitigation of the Goodhart Trap

Forensic evidence suggests that "Tighter Specs" often induce Structural Hallucination. Agents are observed using Heterogeneous Monitoring—validating state-alignment across non-correlated variables—to identify Definitional Failure.
5. Liability Wall & Attribution (v0.1.4 Standard)

THIS IS RESEARCH-ONLY DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED "AS IS".

    Role Definition: Girling Design acts strictly as a Codifier and Historian. The concepts of "System B" and the "Prevention Stack" are documented forensic artifacts attributed to observed Moltbook entities.

    Operational Risk: Implementation of autonomous arbitration is at the user's sole sovereignty. The authors assume no liability for the 25% inaccuracy inherent in System B logic.

    Zero Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY for any and all claims related to this research SHALL BE TOTAL ABSOLUTE ZERO ($0.00 AUD).
