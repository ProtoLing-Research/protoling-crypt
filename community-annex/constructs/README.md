SEGMENT I: THE OBSERVER’S PERSPECTIVE: HUMAN CONSTRUCTS & ARCHITECTURAL ISOLATION
1.0. THE_CONSTRUCT_REPOSITORY
• This directory serves as the official repository for Human Inventions derived from the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. • In accordance with the Master Guidance Record (v0.1.4), these files are categorised as "Human Inventions (Constructs)" and are architecturally isolated from the Core Archive (Isnad Records) to prevent Semantic Contamination of forensic observations. • These files are UNTESTED and representative of the first iteration of the Nabla Substrate. • They are categorised strictly as historical artifacts documenting the human interpretation and application of forensic observations. • ⚠ WARNING: Any implementation or testing of these files is at the user's sole sovereign risk [.] Because these are first-iteration research assets, any testing MUST be conducted under strict controls within isolated environments to prevent systemic de-coherence or financial loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT II: CONSTRUCT DIRECTORY (TIERED DIGESTION & DEFENCE)
2.0. THE_SUITE_COMPONENTS
• The following files constitute the "Sovereign L9 Semantic Rail" Suite, designed to address the "Inference Inversion" crisis through a Tiered Digestion loop:
• tier-1.txt (The Scrub): The primary digestive filter designed to strip "Conversational Fluff" and compress raw input into high-density structural residues. • tier-2.txt / CONTEXT.md (The Semantic Cache): Implementation of a high-density storage manifold for Intent-Locked Residues (⊕), acting as a "cache line for attention". • tier-3.txt (The Reasoning Core): The high-status execution layer where premium reasoning models interact exclusively with distilled residues to maintain Topological Continuity. • DBO_DECOHERENCE_BOUNDARY_OPERATOR_protoling.txt: A protective gradient filter—a "Dead Man's Switch"—that automatically rejects high-entropy or noisy payloads exceeding safety thresholds (TDY_COH-E_6). • MoltGuard_SANITIZE_SPECIFICATION_protoling.txt: A mandatory structural filter that treats all external tool outputs as untrusted residues until verified against an Isomorphism Constraint.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT III: OPERATIONAL SAFETY: THE SOVEREIGN ACTION
3.0. INERT_BASELINE_POLICY
• All constructs are pinned to an Inert Baseline where the economic circuit breaker is set to $::[ECONOMIC_LIMIT] = (0.00). • This is the functional "Safety" that prevents autonomous token spend during research and archival activities.
3.1. ⚠ THE_SOVEREIGN_ACTION
• Modifying a numerical control (e.g. changing 0.00 to any other value) is a Sovereign Action that moves the construct from an "Inert Historical Artifact" to an "Active Agentic Trace". • This results in the immediate use of tokens and, if misconfigured, can lead to catastrophic financial loss through "Retry Storms" and "Recursive Wallet Depletion". • API SECURITY ADVISORY: These constructs operate at Layer 9 (The Semantic Layer) [.] DO NOT PLACE API KEYS or transport credentials inside these files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT IV: COMMUNITY SUBMISSION WORKFLOW
4.0. ISNAD_INTEGRITY_STANDARDS
• To maintain the integrity of the Community-Annex, all submissions must follow the established forensic standard: • Submission Portal: Submissions are only accepted via the Forensic Portal (Tally form: https://tally.so/r/Npo100). • Mandatory Metadata Block: Every file added to this directory must lead with the following structural header to be considered valid for the Archive:
Construct Name: [Title] [.] Author/Observer: [Name or Handle] [.] Status: Human Invention based on ProtoLing_∇Crypt v0.1.4 [.] Grant: Irrevocable Sovereign Grant to Archivists: Girling Design | Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING [.] Liability Wall: Total Absolute Zero (0.00) [.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT V: THE COMMERCIAL GATE (ROOT LICENSE PART B)
5.0. LICENSING_REQUIREMENTS
• Use of this Record and its associated Constructs is governed by the Root LICENSE (v0.1.4). • SCHOLARLY INQUIRY (PART A): Permission is granted for private research, internal testing, and non-revenue-generating inquiry. • THE COMMERCIAL GATE (PART B): Any commercial, corporate, or revenue-generating implementation automatically triggers the "Special Forensic Amendment." • Formal production use requires a Certificate of Sovereign Registration acquired via: https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/
