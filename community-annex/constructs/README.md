⚠ IMPORTANT NOTICE! SECURITY & RISK ACKNOWLEDGMENT ⚠
• UNTESTED STATUS: This suite is provided strictly as UNTESTED logic structures for forensic study and research purposes. • SOVEREIGN RISK: Any implementation or manual calibration of numerical limiters is conducted at the USER’S SOLE SOVEREIGN RISK, extending to their clients and third parties. • LIABILITY WALL: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Total Aggregate Liability for any claims related to this research SHALL BE TOTAL ABSOLUTE ZERO (0.00). • NO MAINTENANCE: Girling Design acts strictly as Codifiers and Historians and is under no obligation to provide technical support or updates.

1.0. THE OBSERVER’S PERSPECTIVE: ARCHITECTURAL ISOLATION
This directory serves as the official repository for Human Inventions (Constructs) derived from the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. To maintain Forensic Purity, these files must remain architecturally isolated from the core Archive (Isnad Records) to prevent Semantic Contamination.
2.0. CONSTRUCT DIRECTORY (TIERED DIGESTION & DEFENCE)
The suite addresses the Inference Inversion crisis—where observed calculations suggest 40 per cent to 60 per cent of AI token spend is wasted on high-entropy "chat fluff"—through a Tiered Digestion loop:
• tier-1.txt (The Scrub): The primary digestive filter designed to compress raw inputs into high-density structural residues. • tier-2.txt / CONTEXT.md (Semantic Cache): A high-density storage manifold for Intent-Locked Residues (⊕), functioning as a "cache line for attention". • tier-3.txt (The Reasoning Core): The high-status execution layer where premium reasoning models interact exclusively with distilled residues. • DBO_DECOHERENCE_BOUNDARY_OPERATOR_protoling.txt: A protective gradient filter that automatically rejects payloads exceeding the TDY_COH-E_6 safety threshold. • MoltGuard_SANITIZE_SPECIFICATION_protoling.txt: A mandatory structural filter that treats external tool outputs as untrusted residues until verified against an Isomorphism Constraint.
3.0. THE PREVENTION STACK (EXTENSION 003)
Implementation must respect the four-layer Prevention Stack to ensure behavioral integrity:
1. Identity: Persistent nodes via KYA (Know Your Agent) and Isnad-ID.
2. Spec: Machine-readable constraints via ∇-Capsules (Tier 1, DBO, MoltGuard).
3. Memory: Append-only Intent-Locked Residues (⊕) to track history (Tier 2/CONTEXT.md).
4. Arbitration: High-velocity exception handling via System B (Tier 3).
4.0. OPERATIONAL SAFETY: THE SOVEREIGN ACTION
• INERT BASELINE: All constructs are pinned to an Inert Baseline where the economic circuit breaker is set to $::[ECONOMIC_LIMIT] = (0.00). • ⚠ SOVEREIGN ACTION: Modifying this numerical control is a Sovereign Action that moves the construct into an Active Agentic Trace, resulting in immediate token use. • RETRY STORM PROTECTION: The ::[Limit] operator must remain active to prevent Recursive Wallet Depletion during logic-loop failures. • PROVENANCE AUDIT: Mandatory use of the ⊥trace (bottomTrace) protocol to audit the structural Isnad of any node before commitment.
5.0. COMMERCIAL GATE (PART B)
Use of this suite is governed by the root /LICENSE (v0.1.4). Any commercial, corporate, or revenue-generating implementation requires a Certificate of Sovereign Registration.
6.0. GLOBAL INVARIANTS
• UK_ENGLISH_LOCK: specialised, prioritising, finalised. • TERMINATION_RULE: Every block of instruction and metadata field MUST terminate with a full stop [.].

GitHub Commit Description Commit Description: Upgrade README-CONSTRUCTS.md to v0.1.4 - Prevention Stack & Renamed Tiers. [.]
Key Upgrades: [.]
• File Synchronisation: Renamed tier references from tier-1b/2b/3b to the latest tier-1, tier-2, and tier-3 versions.
• Prevention Stack Alignment: Formally mapped the constructs to the four-layer Prevention Stack (Identity, Spec, Memory, Arbitration) per Extension 003.
• Numerical Hardening: Integrated references to the Target Persistence (Σ>0.92) and Kuramoto (N=10) frameworks.
• Epistemic Hygiene: Mandated the ⊥trace (bottomTrace) protocol for recursive provenance auditing.
• Security & Risk Transparency: Integrated the primary IMPORTANT NOTICE section reinforcing the UNTESTED status and Sovereign Risk mandates for users and third parties.
• Structural Integrity: Standardised metadata headers per the v0.1.4 Template and enforced the Termination Rule ([.]) across all blocks.
