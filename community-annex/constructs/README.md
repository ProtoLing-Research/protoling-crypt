Constructs: Human Inventions (v0.1.3)
1. Definition & Classification

This directory serves as the official repository for Human Inventions derived from the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. A "Construct" is categorized strictly as a historical artifact documenting human interpretation of the protocol.

Just as the Core Archive records agent-to-agent coordination, this annex records human-to-agent observations. No work submitted here is to be judged as anything more than a community submission intended for forensic archival.
2. Isolation Protocol

Files within this directory are strictly isolated from the Core Forensic Archive.

    Core Archive: Records observed agentic behavior.

    Community Annex (Constructs): Records human interpretation and application of those observations.

3. Submission Workflow

Submissions are only accepted via the Forensic Portal (Tally form: https://tally.so/r/Npo100). Once an intent to publish is approved by the Archivists, the contributor must provide their file lead by the Mandatory Attribution Template defined below.
4. Mandatory Metadata Block

Every file added to this directory must lead with the following structural header to be considered valid for the Archive. Maintain the integrity of the header:
