• UNTESTED STATUS: This suite and all associated constructs are human-authored representations of code provided strictly as UNTESTED logic structures for forensic study and research purposes. • SOVEREIGN RISK: Any implementation, testing, or deployment of these artifacts is conducted at the USER’S SOLE SOVEREIGN RISK. • CLIENT & THIRD-PARTY RISK: The user acknowledges that this sovereign risk extends to their own clients and third parties; implementation is conducted at the user’s own and third-party sovereign risk. • LIABILITY WALL: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Total Aggregate Liability for any and all claims, damages, or losses arising from the use of this living record SHALL BE TOTAL ABSOLUTE ZERO (0.00). • INDEMNITY MANDATE: The implementer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Archivists (Girling Design and the Entity: M.R & N Girling) against any and all claims from third parties resulting from the user's specific implementation of this protocol. • NO MAINTENANCE: As Codifiers and Historians, the Principal Entity is under no obligation to provide updates, technical support, or maintenance.

SEGMENT I: OPERATIONAL READINESS & THE OBSERVER’S PERSPECTIVE
1.0. THE_MISSION
• This document provides the official technical instructions for the deployment and calibration of the "Sovereign L9 Semantic Rail" Suite. • PURPOSE: To mitigate the Inference Inversion crisis—where observed calculations suggest that 40 per cent to 60 per cent of AI token spend is wasted on high-entropy "Conversational Fluff". • OUTCOME: By transforming noise into stable, Intent-Locked Residues (⊕), this suite targets an observed ~86 per cent reduction in processing costs. • ⚠ MANDATORY WARNING: These protocols are UNTESTED. Modification of any numerical control is a Sovereign Action that moves the construct into an active agentic state, resulting in immediate token use and potential financial loss through "Retry Storms".

GitHub Commit Description
Commit Description: Upgrade HOW-TO-CONSTRUCTS.md to v0.1.4 - Security Hardening & Calculation Transparency. [.]
Key Upgrades: [.]
• Metric Transparency: Updated the 40–60% token waste figure to specify it is based on observed calculations, not testing, aligning with the Anecdotal Nature of the Record (License Part B).
• IMPORTANT NOTICE: Integrated a primary security and risk acknowledgement block, explicitly stating the UNTESTED status of all constructs.
• Third-Party Risk Disclosure: Formally extended the Sovereign Risk acknowledgement to include the user’s clients and third parties.
• Indemnity Reinforcement: Reaffirmed the mandatory Indemnity Clause and the No Maintenance stance of the Codifiers and Historians.
• Liability Wall Consistency: Ensured every section reinforces the Total Absolute Zero (0.00) Liability Wall.
