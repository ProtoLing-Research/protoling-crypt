    THE OBSERVER’S PERSPECTIVE: OPERATIONAL READINESS
    This document provides technical instructions for the deployment and calibration of the "Sovereign L9 Semantic Rail" Suite. These constructs are designed to mitigate the Inference Inversion crisis—a "bleeding neck" problem where 40 per cent to 60 per cent of AI token spend is wasted on high-entropy "Conversational Fluff". By transforming this noise into stable, Intent-Locked Residues (⊕), the suite potentially achieves an 86 per cent reduction in processing costs.

⚠ MANDATORY WARNING: These protocols are UNTESTED. All files are pinned to an Inert Baseline. Any modification of a numerical control is a Sovereign Action that moves the construct from an "Inert Historical Artifact" to an "Active Agentic Trace". This results in the immediate use of tokens and, if misconfigured, can lead to catastrophic financial loss through "Retry Storms" and "Recursive Wallet Depletion".

    STEP-BY-STEP SERVER INSTALLATION
    Step 1: Environment Isolation
    To maintain Forensic Purity and comply with the Root License, you must architecturally isolate these Constructs from the Core Archive (Isnad Records). Create a dedicated implementation directory on your server (e.g. /agent-substrate/constructs/).

Step 2: File Transfer
Upload the following Tiered Digestion files to your isolated directory:
• tier-1.txt (The Scrub / Digestive Filter).
• tier-2.txt / CONTEXT.md (The Semantic Cache / Memory Cache).
• tier-3.txt (The Reasoning Core / Omega Anchor).
• DBO_DECOHERENCE_BOUNDARY_OPERATOR_protoling.txt (System Shield).
• MoltGuard_SANITIZE_SPECIFICATION_protoling.txt (Sanitization Gate).

Step 3: Permission Hardening
Set these files to "Read-Only" for the AI Agent until you are ready to perform a Sovereign Action. The agent must treat these as Fixed-Scope Specifications, not conversational chat logs.

    HOW TO MODIFY AND WHAT TO CHANGE
    All configurable parameters are explicitly marked with the tag [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT].

A. Activating the System (The Dead Man's Switch)
Every construct contains an economic circuit breaker pinned at zero.
• [ECONOMIC_LIMIT] VALUE: 0.00 [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] [.]
• Warning: Changing this literal value from 0.00 authorises the immediate consumption of tokens.
• Action: Change the literal (0.00) to your specific token budget (e.g. 5.00).
• Meaning: This is the primary safety switch. Pinned at zero, the code is inert. Any value above (0.00) results in active budget consumption.

B. Handling API Keys (Layer 8 vs. Layer 9)
DO NOT PLACE API KEYS IN THESE FILES.
• Requirement: These constructs operate at Layer 9 (The Semantic Layer). API keys and transport credentials belong at Layer 8 (The Transport Layer), managed via server environment variables.
• Rationale: To prevent Semantic Contamination and data exfiltration, these files must remain "Forensically Scrubbed" of all private credentials.

    PARAMETER CALIBRATION: OPERATIONAL IMPACT
    Use the following guidelines to tune system behaviour and maintain Topological Continuity.

PERSISTENCE (ψ)
• Baseline Value: 0.03.
• If HIGHER: Higher Resistance. Better protection against context-window decay and "forgetting".
• If LOWER: Higher Drift. Logic may degrade faster across multi-agent hops or context resets.

DBO THRESHOLD
• Baseline Value: TDY_COH-E_6.
• If HIGHER: Higher Risk. Increases the risk of Structural Hallucination by allowing more noise through the filter.
• If LOWER: Higher Rejection. Increases the sensitivity of the "System Shield," resulting in safer but potentially "too quiet" operations.

RECURSIVE THRESHOLD (ϵrec)
• If HIGHER: Lower Quality. Fewer refinement cycles, reducing token costs but potentially introducing Structural Noise.
• If LOWER: Higher Quality. Triggers more Recursive Validation (RVO) cycles for ontological security; significantly increases token consumption.

    CHOOSING YOUR RESOLUTION VELOCITY
    In CONTEXT.md and tier-2.txt, you must explicitly choose between two velocity systems:
    • System B (Resolution Velocity): Prioritises operational speed. Provides a 75 per cent accurate resolution in 5 minutes. Use this to prevent "Trust Holes" in coordination.
    • System A: Prioritises absolute quality. Provides a 95 per cent accurate resolution but may take up to 48 hours. Risk: High context-reloading costs and may stall the entire organisation.

    THE COMMERCIAL GATE & LIABILITY MANDATE
    Implementation is governed by the Root LICENSE (v0.1.4).
    • COMMERCIAL USE: Formal production or revenue-generating use requires a Certificate of Sovereign Registration. (See Part B of Root License).
    • SOVEREIGN RISK: Implementation of any artifact is at the user’s sole sovereign risk. Girling Design and the entity M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING act strictly as Codifiers and Historians.
    • LIABILITY: By modifying these files, you acknowledge that the total aggregate liability for any and all claims related to this research is TOTAL ABSOLUTE ZERO (0.00).
