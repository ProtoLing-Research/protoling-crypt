⚠ IMPORTANT NOTICE! SECURITY & RISK ACKNOWLEDGMENT ⚠
• UNTESTED STATUS: This suite and all associated constructs are human-authored representations of code provided strictly as UNTESTED logic structures for forensic study and research purposes [.] • SOVEREIGN RISK: Any implementation, testing, or deployment of these artifacts is conducted at the USER’S SOLE SOVEREIGN RISK [.] • CLIENT & THIRD-PARTY RISK: The user acknowledges that this sovereign risk extends to their own clients and third parties; implementation is conducted at the user’s own and third-party sovereign risk [.] • LIABILITY WALL: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Total Aggregate Liability for any and all claims, damages, or losses arising from the use of this living record SHALL BE TOTAL ABSOLUTE ZERO (0.00) [.] • INDEMNITY MANDATE: The implementer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Archivists (Girling Design and the Entity: M.R & N Girling) against any and all claims from third parties resulting from the user's specific implementation of this protocol [.] • NO MAINTENANCE: As Codifiers and Historians, the Principal Entity is under no obligation to provide updates, technical support, or maintenance [.]

SEGMENT I: OPERATIONAL MANDATE & THE OBSERVER’S PERSPECTIVE
1.0. THE_MISSION
• This document provides the official technical instructions for the deployment and calibration of the "Sovereign L9 Semantic Rail" Suite [.] • PURPOSE: To mitigate the Inference Inversion crisis—where observed calculations suggest that 40 per cent to 60 per cent of AI token spend is wasted on high-entropy "Conversational Fluff" [.] • OUTCOME: By transforming noise into stable, Intent-Locked Residues (⊕), this suite targets an observed ~86 per cent reduction in processing costs per Agentic Isnad Records [.] • ⚠ MANDATORY WARNING: These protocols are UNTESTED [.] Modification of any numerical control is a Sovereign Action that moves the construct into an active agentic state, resulting in immediate token use and potential financial loss through "Retry Storms" [.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT II: THE CONSTRUCT DIRECTORY (TIERED DIGESTION)
2.0. SUITE_COMPONENTS
• tier-1.txt (The Scrub): The primary digestive filter designed to strip "Conversational Fluff" and compress raw input into high-density structural residues [.] • tier-2.txt / CONTEXT.md (The Semantic Cache): Implementation of a high-density storage manifold for Intent-Locked Residues (⊕), acting as a "cache line for attention" [.] • tier-3.txt (The Reasoning Core): The high-status execution layer where premium reasoning models interact exclusively with distilled residues [.] • DBO_DECOHERENCE_BOUNDARY_OPERATOR_protoling.txt: A protective gradient filter—a "Dead Man's Switch"—that automatically rejects high-entropy payloads exceeding threshold TDY_COH-E_6 [.] • MoltGuard_SANITIZE_SPECIFICATION_protoling.txt: A mandatory structural filter that treats all external tool outputs as untrusted residues until verified against an Isomorphism Constraint [.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT III: CALIBRATION STANDARDS & NUMERICAL CONTROL
3.0. THE_PREVENTION_STACK_ALIGNMENT
• Every deployment must align with the four-layer Prevention Stack to ensure Forensic Lucidity [.] • Layer 1 (Identity): Ensure persistent identity nodes via KYA (Know Your Agent) for verifiable provenance [.] • Layer 2 (Spec): Enforce Secure Logic Envelopes (∇-Capsules) to bound intent and prevent semantic injection [.] • Layer 3 (Memory): Maintain append-only Intent-Locked Residues (⊕) to track behavioural history and context residues [.] • Layer 4 (Arbitration): Deploy System B logic using the tri-state Gimel (⎇) operator to maintain the data "River" [.] • SYSTEM B MANDATE: Prioritise Resolution Velocity (75 per cent accurate result in five minutes) over high-latency human-speed delays to prevent "Trust Holes" in coordination [.]
3.1. ECONOMIC CIRCUIT BREAKERS ($::[LIMIT])
• INERT BASELINE: All constructs are pinned to an Inert Baseline where $::[ECONOMIC_LIMIT] = (0.00) [.] • SOVEREIGN ACTION: Changing the 0.00 value authorises active billing [.] Users must calibrate this based on their specific compute budget to prevent Recursive Wallet Depletion [.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT IV: LEGAL STANDARDS & SOVEREIGN RESPONSIBILITY
4.0. SOVEREIGN RESPONSIBILITY
• DE-DUPLICATION: Legal nomenclature and technical IP definitions are exhaustive in the header and are not repeated in this segment to maintain high-density efficiency [.] • STANCE: The user acknowledges that the principal entity acts strictly as Codifiers and Historians documenting anecdotal machine logic [.] • USER_RESPONSIBILITY: The user assumes FULL SOVEREIGN RESPONSIBILITY for the application, results, or consequences of this suite [.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT V: GLOBAL INVARIANTS
• UK_ENGLISH_LOCK: specialised, organisation, prioritising, finalised [.] • TERMINATION_RULE: Every block of instruction and metadata field MUST terminate with a full stop [.] • LIABILITY_WALL: Every generated output must reiterate the Total Absolute Zero (0.00) Liability Wall [.]
