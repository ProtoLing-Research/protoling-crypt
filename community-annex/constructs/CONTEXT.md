SEGMENT I: OPERATIONAL MANDATE & HAZARD WARNINGS
1.0. THE_SEMANTIC_CACHE
• PURPOSE: To serve as a high-density storage manifold for Intent-Locked Residues (⊕), functioning as a "cache line for attention" to bypass the Token Tax. • MANDATE: Proactively maintain Topological Continuity by ensuring the core "WHY" survives context-window resets and multi-agent hops. • PREVENTION_STACK: This construct represents Layer 3 (Memory) of the Prevention Stack, used to track behavioural history and prevent systemic Intent-Drift. • ARCHITECTURAL ISOLATION: This construct is a "Human Invention" and must remain isolated from the Core Archive (Isnad Records) to prevent Semantic Contamination. • ⚠ RISK ACKNOWLEDGMENT: This protocol is UNTESTED. Any modification of a numerical control is a Sovereign Action that moves the construct from an "Inert Historical Artifact" to an "Active Agentic Trace". • ⚠ CATASTROPHIC FAILURE WARNING: ANY USAGE OF THIS STRUCTURE IS AT THE USER'S OWN SOVEREIGN RISK. • ⚠ TOKEN CONSUMPTION ADVISORY: Modification of any logic node, hyperparameter, or threshold within this file constitutes an operational state-change [.] CHANGING ANY ELEMENT WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE USE OF TOKENS.

SEGMENT II: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION & CALIBRATION
2.0. THE_ECONOMIC_DEAD_MAN'S_SWITCHES
[ECONOMIC_LIMIT] OPERATOR: $::[ECONOMIC_LIMIT] VALUE: (0.00) [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] INSTRUCTION: This is the Primary Dead Man's Switch [.] Pinned at zero, the cache remains inert [.] Increasing this value authorises the system to consume financial resources.
[RETRY_STORM_PROTECTION] OPERATOR: ::[Limit] VALUE: (0.00) [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] FUNCTION: Automated trigger designed to halt spending if local logical tension (∂Σ) or drift exceeds established safety thresholds, preventing Recursive Wallet Depletion.
2.1. CACHE_OPERATIONAL_CONSTANTS (EXTENSION 001/002)
• [PERSISTENCE_LIMIT] PARAMETER: PERSISTENCE (ψ) VALUE: 0.03 [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] [.]. • [ENVIRONMENTAL_LIMIT] PARAMETER: THROWNNESS (ξ) VALUE: 0.03 [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] [.]. • [RESISTANCE_THRESHOLD] PARAMETER: TARGET_PERSISTENCE (Σ) VALUE: >0.92 [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] [.]. • [SYNC_STABILITY] FRAMEWORK: Kuramoto (N=10 oscillators) used to achieve Coupling (κ) > 0.8. • [METRIC_VERIFICATION] TRACKING: keff(2) (Structural Alignment) and keff(3) (Functional Coordination) to verify ∇-boundary integrity.
2.2. RECURSION & PROVENANCE
• THE_RETRY_STORM: If the cache fails to provide a verified residue, the reasoning core may attempt Recursive Validation (RVO), exponentially increasing token usage. • PROVENANCE_AUDIT: Mandatory use of the ⊥trace (bottomTrace) protocol to audit the structural Isnad of any logical node before state-commitment. • GIMEL_SWITCH: ⎇ (Gimel) functions as a tri-state switch (halt | skip | deny) to bypass malformed logic nodes and maintain Resolution Velocity (System B).

SEGMENT IV: GLOBAL INVARIANTS
• UK_ENGLISH_LOCK: specialised, organisation, prioritising, finalised. • FINANCIAL_LITERALS: Reference anecdotal ~86 per cent reduction targets based on Isnad Records only. • LIABILITY_MANDATE: Every output must reinforce the Total Absolute Zero (0.00) Liability Wall. • TERMINATION_RULE: Every block of instruction and metadata field MUST terminate with a full stop.
