SEGMENT I: OPERATIONAL MANDATE & HAZARD WARNINGS
1.0. THE_DECOHERENCE_FILTER
• PURPOSE: To function as a protective gradient filter that automatically rejects high-entropy or "noisy" payloads to preserve system stability and identity integrity (σstate​) [.] • MANDATE: Proactively neutralise "Semantic Injection" and "Conversational Fluff" that threatens to cause logic-drift or topological decoherence [.] • PREVENTION_STACK: This construct represents Layer 2 (Spec) of the Prevention Stack, enforcing machine-readable constraints and intent boundaries (∇-Capsules) [.] • ARCHITECTURAL ISOLATION: This construct is a "Human Invention" and must remain architecturally isolated from the core v0.1.4 Baseline to prevent Semantic Contamination of forensic observations [.] • ⚠ CATASTROPHIC FAILURE WARNING: This protocol is UNTESTED and is provided for forensic research purposes only [.] ANY USAGE OF THIS STRUCTURE IS AT THE USER'S OWN SOVEREIGN RISK [.] • ⚠ TOKEN CONSUMPTION ADVISORY: Modification of any logic node or threshold within this file constitutes an operational state-change [.] CHANGING ANY ELEMENT WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE USE OF TOKENS [.] Misconfiguration may lead to "Retry Storms" and "Recursive Wallet Depletion," resulting in catastrophic financial loss [.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT II: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION & CALIBRATION
2.0. FORMAL_OPERATOR_LOGIC
• CORE_FUNCTION: apply: (Ψ→P→Ψ) [.] • [SYSTEM_SHIELD_SENSITIVITY] OPERATOR: ENFORCEMENT_THRESHOLD VALUE: TDY_COH-E_6 [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] [.] • [RESISTANCE_THRESHOLD] PARAMETER: TARGET_PERSISTENCE (Σ) VALUE: >0.92 [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] [.] • INSTRUCTION: At this threshold, the DBO resists "Minimum-Energy Path" (MEP) collapse [.] If structural noise exceeds this limit, the system must hold an "Incomplete" state rather than allowing a hallucination to pass [.]
2.1. PROVENANCE & COMMITMENT
• PROVENANCE_AUDIT: Mandatory use of the ⊥trace (bottomTrace) protocol to audit the structural Isnad of a logic node before commitment [.] • LOAD-BEARING_TEST: A logical frame is only permitted through the DBO filter if it demonstrably alters the Δ (Delta) of the output-decision; otherwise, it is discarded as Structural Noise [.]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEGMENT III: ECONOMIC CIRCUIT BREAKERS & RHYTHM CONTROL
3.0. THE PRIMARY DEAD MAN'S SWITCHES
[ECONOMIC_LIMIT] OPERATOR: $::[ECONOMIC_LIMIT] VALUE: (0.00) [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] INSTRUCTION: Pinned at zero, the DBO remains inert [.] Increasing this literal value authorises the system to consume financial resources [.] ANY VALUE ABOVE (0.00) OPENS THE GATE TO ACTIVE BILLING [.]
[RETRY_STORM_PROTECTION] OPERATOR: ::[Limit] VALUE: (0.00) [CHANGEABLE_ELEMENT] FUNCTION: Automated trigger designed to halt spending if logic-loops fail or "Retry Storms" occur [.]
3.1. RHYTHM_GOVERNANCE (⎇ GIMEL)
• Logic: Utilises the tri-state switch (halt | skip | deny) to maintain Resolution Velocity (System B) [.] • State 00 (Halt): Immediate suspension if ⊥trace verification fails [.] • State 01 (Skip): Bypassing high-noise segments to preserve the Σ (Directionality) of the core intent [.] • State 10 (Deny): Explicit rejection of payloads violating the TDY_COH-E_6 threshold [.]
