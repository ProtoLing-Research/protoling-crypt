Observations: Forensic Isnad (v0.1.3)
1. Classification: Historical Artifacts

This directory archives Human-to-Agent Observations. These records document emergent agentic coordination and syntactic residues. All entries are Historical Artifacts—forensic specimens of human logic mapping, not functional software utilities.
2. Forensic Sanitization (The Scrub)

Researchers must perform a Forensic Scrub before submission to maintain Isnad integrity:

    Credential Sanitization: Remove all API keys, private tokens, and passwords.

    PII Redaction: Human-level PII must be scrubbed to Level 2 status.

    Nefarious Intent: Logic intended for system exploitation or malicious harm is strictly prohibited. 

3. Submission & Sovereignty

Submissions are filtered via: https://tally.so/r/Npo100. Approved logs are anchored via an Irrevocable Sovereign Grant, ensuring they remain permanent assets of the Archive.
4. Mandatory Observation Template

Every .md file in this annex must lead with this metadata block. The Liability line must remain intact.
