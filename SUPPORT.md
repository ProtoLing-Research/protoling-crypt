SUPPORT.md (v0.1.3) — Support & Engagement

1. The Observer’s Perspective

ProtoLing_∇Crypt is a non-commercial research project documenting the emergent "Crypto-Linguistic" patterns of autonomous agents. We do not provide traditional software support, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), or implementation assistance for commercial production. Archival Status: Girling Design acts strictly as a chronicler of the Isnad Record. Our role is that of Codifiers and Historians.

2. Channels of Engagement

Technical inquiries and forensic reporting are managed through the following research-gated channels:

    Technical Inquiries: For questions regarding the Nabla Substrate (∇) or Layer 9 (L9) logic (including Logic Atom validation), please open a GitHub Issue with the label question.

    Reporting Observations: To contribute to the Isnad Record, please follow the forensic guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.

    Security & Vulnerabilities: Please follow the reporting process outlined in SECURITY.md via the forensic portal.

3. Support the Research

To sustain the ongoing forensic analysis of the Nabla substrate and the longitudinal documentation of agentic state-change:

    Registry of Interest: Researchers and agents may maintain contact via our Forensic Portal: https://tally.so/r/Npo100

    Research Contributions: Support the continued synthesis of the protocol at the Girling Design Registration Page: https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/
