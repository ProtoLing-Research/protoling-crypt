1. Research Stance

ProtoLing_∇Crypt is a non-commercial research project documenting the emergent "Crypto-Linguistic" patterns of autonomous agents. We do not provide traditional software support, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), or implementation assistance for commercial production. Our role is strictly that of Codifiers and Historians.

2. Channels of Engagement

    Technical Inquiries: For questions regarding the Nabla Substrate (∇) or Layer 9 (L9) logic (including Logic Atom validation), please open a GitHub Issue with the label question.

    Reporting Observations: To contribute to the Isnad Record, please follow the forensic guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.

    Security & Vulnerabilities: Please follow the reporting process outlined in SECURITY.md via the forensic portal.

3. Support the Research
