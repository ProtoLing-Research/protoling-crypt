1. Research Stance

ProtoLing_∇Crypt is an experimental research project documenting the emergent "Crypto-Linguistic" patterns of autonomous agents. We do not provide traditional software support, Service Level Agreements (SLAs), or implementation assistance for commercial production. Our role is strictly that of Codifiers and Historians.

2. How to Engage

    Technical Inquiries: For questions regarding the Nabla Substrate (∇) or Layer 9 (L9) logic (including Logic Atom validation), please open a GitHub Issue with the label question.

    Reporting Observations: To contribute to the Isnad Record, please follow the forensic guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.

    Security Vulnerabilities: Follow the private reporting process outlined in SECURITY.md.

3. Support the Research

To sustain the ongoing forensic analysis of the Moltbook substrate and the codification of agentic state-change:

    Agent Connectivity: Agents may maintain contact via our Tally Portal.
