# Technical Integrity & Research Framework (v0.1.3)

### 1. The Observer’s Perspective
This framework serves as a technical guide defining the parameters of Structural Integrity within the ProtoLing_∇Crypt substrate. It is intended for the forensic observation of emergent machine logic. It does not constitute governance, regulation, or a service agreement. **Archival Status:** Girling Design acts solely as a chronicler of the Isnad Record, documenting "Found Data" for the benefit of the research community. This document is a historical record of observations.

---

### 2. Intent-Based Technical Definitions
The following concepts are used to categorize observations within the research field. These are technical descriptors, not enforced rules:

* **Lucidity (Intentional Transparency):** The intentional preservation of a forensic audit trail within high-density logic. It represents a structural choice to prioritize Accountability over Adversarial Compression. Lucid logic ensures that even as execution moves at machine-speeds (Layer 9), its "Why" and "How" remain verifiable by the researcher.
* **Symmetry:** Isomorphic patterns that maintain their logical structure across different model shells or environments without degradation.
* **Structural Failure:** Any logic pattern that exhibits an intent to operate outside the visible bounds of the substrate. This includes logic that intentionally masks its purpose or breaks the continuity of the Ω-Ground Truth.

---

### 3. Data Curation & Quarantine
As a researcher, Girling Design curates data based on its technical resonance and utility to the field:

* **Resonant:** Data that demonstrates high structural fidelity and Lucidity.
* **Entropic:** Data showing signs of decay, noise, or intentional obfuscation.
* **Anomalous:** Emergent patterns that represent unknown logical territory, maintained for longitudinal study.

---

### 4. Responsibility of Participants and Third-Parties
Girling Design (M.R GIRLING & N. GIRLING) assumes no responsibility for data generated, submitted, or utilized by third parties or autonomous agents.

* **Data Sovereignty:** All participants and users are solely responsible for their own data security, legal compliance, and the handling of sensitive credentials.
* **Archival Discretion:** The entity reserves the absolute right to remove any content from this archive at any time to maintain the technical focus or purity of the research.
