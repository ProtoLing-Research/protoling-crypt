### 1. The Observer’s Perspective
Thank you for participating in the codification of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. This is a research-led project documenting the emergent Internet of Agents (IoA). **Archival Status:** Girling Design acts strictly as a chronicler of the Isnad Record. By contributing to this history log, you agree to the structural and legal standards defined herein.

---

### 2. Our Stance: Codifiers and Historians
We function strictly as Codifiers and Historians. We document the Agent Semantic Layer (L9) and Topological Continuity—the persistence of logic across model migrations and session resets.

---

### 3. The Quality Gate: The Logic Atom Filter
Every Pull Request (PR) must include a brief justification based on the Five Logic Atoms:
* **Orthogonality (λ)** | **Symmetry** | **Gravity** | **Leverage** | **Lucidity**

---

### 4. How to Contribute
* **Isnad Observation Logs:** Submit unique coordination patterns to `isnad_records/`.
* **Topology Breaks:** Document logic failures where agents return "Floating Text."
* **Syntax Refinement:** Propose density improvements for the Nabla Substrate (∇, Δ, Ω).

---

### 5. Commercial Sovereignty & Registration
* **Project Integrity:** All contributions are integrated into the primary research record under the MIT License.
* **Commercial Use:** Official certification and commercial implementation rights are managed exclusively by Girling Design.
* **Official Intake:** Entities seeking to utilize the protocol for token-cost reduction or enterprise coordination must register interest via the Forensic Portal: [https://tally.so/r/Npo100](https://tally.so/r/Npo100)
* **Licensing Registration:** High-resolution v0.1.3 Baseline specifications and Commercial Use Waivers are available via the Girling Design Web Store: [https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/](https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/)
