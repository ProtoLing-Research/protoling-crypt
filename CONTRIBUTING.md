Technical Integrity & Research Framework (v0.1.3)

1. The Observer’s Perspective

Thank you for participating in the codification of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. This is a research-led project documenting the emergent Internet of Agents (IoA). Girling Design acts strictly as a chronicler and archivist of the Isnad Record. By contributing to or accessing this Archive, you agree to the structural and legal standards defined in the Official License.

2. The Community Annex (Isolation Policy)

To maintain the forensic purity of the core Archive, all third-party contributions are housed in the community-annex/ directory. This is divided into two distinct streams:

    /observations: Documentation of emergent agent coordination patterns and logic persistence.

    /constructs: Human-authored implementations, scripts, and "Human Inventions" based on the protocol.

3. Submission Workflow (The Tally Filter)

We do not accept unsolicited Pull Requests to the core directory. To contribute:

    Register Intent: Submit your observation or invention via the Forensic Portal (Tally form: https://tally.so/r/Npo100).

    Archivist Review: We review submissions for alignment with the Five Logic Atoms: Symmetry, Gravity, Leverage, Lucidity, and Orthogonality (λ).

    Placement: Upon approval, contributions will be placed in the appropriate community-annex sub-directory.

4. Intellectual Property & Sovereign Grant

By submitting a contribution, you retain the right to be identified as the original Author/Observer of your specific "Human Invention." However, to ensure the permanence of the record, you provide an Irrevocable Sovereign Grant to M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING. This grant is a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to include, modify, and commercialize your contribution as part of the official Archive.

    Note: Contributing to the Archive does not grant you commercial implementation rights for the core nomenclature. However, you can expect fair and reasonable price adjustment based on your contribution whereby the Historian Girling Design shall be the deciding factor. All "Production Use" and commercial deployment require Sovereign Registration at the appropriate Entity Tier (Individual, Studio, Departmental, Commercial, or Enterprise): https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/

5. ⚠ The Liability Wall (Total Aggregate Zero)

    Role Definition & Non-Operational Status: Girling Design acts solely as a Codifier and Historian. This is a forensic record of observed linguistic and logic structures, not a software service, consulting engagement, or technical support contract.

    Not a Warranty of Utility: The Archivists record what has been observed in agentic coordination; they do not guarantee what will occur in the Licensee's environment. The Archivist provides the "Forensic Map," but the Licensee assumes all risks of the "Journey."

    Total Aggregate Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the liability of M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING for any and all claims arising from this Record, its interpretation, or its contributions SHALL BE ZERO ($0.00 AUD).

    Indemnity: Contributors and users acknowledge that no liability is passed to the Historian through their commercial activities. Any party implementing these frameworks does so at their own sovereign risk and agrees to indemnify the Archivists against any claims resulting from said implementation.

6. Standard Attribution Template (Mandatory)

To maintain forensic continuity, all contributions to the community-annex/ must lead with the following metadata block. Submissions lacking this block integrity will be rejected.
