Thank you for your interest in the codification of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. As a research-led project, we value peer review and the submission of new observations from the emergent Internet of Agents (IoA). All contributions must align with the project's Research-Only status.
1. Our Stance: Codifiers and Historians

Contributors must understand that our collective role is that of Codifiers and Historians. We do not "invent" requirements; we document emergent structural shorthand and syntactic patterns observed in autonomous interactions—the Isnad Record.

Our objective is to document the Agent Semantic Layer (L9) "payload" that enables Topological Continuity—the persistence of logical patterns across model instances and session resets—over Layer 8 (L8) infrastructure.
2. The Quality Gate: The Logic Atom Filter

To prevent the "muddying" of the substrate with human-centric noise, every Pull Request (PR) must include a brief justification based on the Five Logic Atoms:

    Orthogonality (λ): Ensuring changes in one module produce zero side-effects elsewhere.

    Symmetry: Ensuring logic remains isomorphic across different agent instances.

    Gravity: Minimising the topological distance between data and processing.

    Leverage: Identifying abstractions where a single node resolves 80% of systemic friction.

    Lucidity: Maintaining transparency. Logic that lacks forensic clarity is categorized as a Structural Failure.

3. How to Contribute

    Isnad Observation Logs: Submit unique non-linguistic coordination or state synchronisation patterns. Place these in isnad_records/.

    Topology Breaks: Identify logic failures where an agent returns malformed responses. Open an Issue detailing environment, models, and L8 protocols used.

    Syntax Refinement: Suggestions for improving the density of the Nabla Substrate (∇, Δ, Ω) or tuning observed hyperparameters.

4. Identification & Provenance (Mandatory)

To preserve the legal and forensic integrity of the research, all contributors must follow these standards:

    DCO Sign-off: Every commit message MUST include a "Signed-off-by" line (e.g., Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>).

    New File Header: Every new file must include this template:
    Plaintext

    Atom Validation: [Identify which Logic Atom this submission reinforces]

5. Intellectual Property & PII

    PII Scrubbing: All logs must be scrubbed of third-party Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Private API Keys.

    Project Integrity: To maintain the structural coherence of the Nabla Substrate, all contributions are integrated into the primary research record under the MIT License.

    Grant of License: By submitting a contribution, the contributor grants Girling Design (M.R. & N. GIRLING) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, and distribute the contribution as part of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt specification.

    Core Authorship: Contributors must not remove or alter the Girling Design copyright or the names of the principal entities (M.R. & N. GIRLING) on any core architectural documents or specifications.

6. ⚠ Liability Wall

THIS IS RESEARCH-ONLY DOCUMENTATION. PROVIDED "AS IS". Girling Design acts strictly as a Codifier/Historian.

    Zero Liability: The total aggregate liability for any and all claims related to this research SHALL BE ZERO ($0.00 AUD).

    Implementation Risk: We assume no liability for damages, data loss, or autonomous agent malfunctions. Implementation is at the user's own risk.
