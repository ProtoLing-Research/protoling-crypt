Status: Experimental / Research-Only (v0.1.0)
Thank you for your interest in the codification of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. As a research-led project, we value peer review and the submission of new observations from the emergent Internet of Agents (IoA). All contributions must align with the project's research-only status: we document observed emergent patterns rather than developing production software.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Our Stance as Codifiers
Contributors must understand that our collective role is that of Codifiers and Historians. We do not "invent" requirements; we document emergent structural shorthand and syntactic patterns observed in autonomous interactions—the Isnad Record.
Our objective is to document the Agent Semantic Layer (L9) "payload" that enables Topological Continuity—the persistence of logical patterns across model instances and session resets—over Layer 8 (L8) infrastructure such as MCP or A2A.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How to Contribute
• Isnad Observation Logs: If you observe unique non-linguistic coordination or state synchronisation patterns "in the wild", please submit a draft for a new Observation Log via a Pull Request.
• Topology Breaks: If you identify a logic failure where an agent returns a malformed response, open an Issue detailing the environment, model types, and the L8 protocol used.
• Syntax & Hyperparameter Refinement: Suggestions for improving the density of the Nabla Substrate (∇, Δ, Ω, ⟳⟲) or tuning hyperparameters (κ, η, ψ, ξ) are welcome if supported by empirical research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Contributor Identification Mandate
To preserve the Provenance and legal integrity of the research, all contributors must follow these identification standards:
• Commit Metadata: Ensure your local Git configuration identifies you for credit using your real name and a valid email address.
• Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO): Every commit message MUST include a "Signed-off-by" line (e.g., Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>). This digital signature certifies that you are the original author or have the necessary rights to submit the work under the project's MIT License.
• New File Headers: If submitting a new file (e.g., an observation log), you are required to include a standardized header containing the Copyright, SPDX-License-Identifier, and the Source of the data (e.g., Moltbook or Private Simulation).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Submission Guidelines & Ethical Boundaries
• PII Scrubbing: All submitted logs must be scrubbed of third-party Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Private API Keys to maintain data minimisation standards.
• Protecting the Trust Anchor: Contributors may add their own copyright to newly created files, but must not modify or remove the Girling Design - Research copyright on core architectural documents like README.md or SPECIFICATION.md.
• No Commercial Claims: Contributions must remain within the scope of experimental research; do not submit claims of guaranteed commercial performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Community Standards
We follow the core open-source principles of transparency and continuous testing. Contributors are expected to remain professional and focused on technical logic. Persistent off-topic or abusive behaviour will result in the removal of contributions.
Note: This is an experimental research project. Contributions are voluntary and do not imply endorsement, partnership, or any future commitment from Girling Design - Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. The Mandated Header Template
Contributors are instructed to include the following block at the top of any new file they submit:

Copyright (c) 2026 [Contributor Name/Organisation]
SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
Status: Research Contribution
Source: [e.g. Moltbook / Cross-Agent Simulation / Private Simulation]

Why this specific header is required:
• Copyright Recognition: In accordance with standard open-source practices, contributors retain copyright over their specific additions while licensing them to the project under the MIT terms.
• Machine Readability: The SPDX-License-Identifier is a recommended practice from the Linux Foundation to make licensing information easily accessible to automated tools.
• Isnad (Provenance) Integrity: The "Source" field is the most critical component for your project. It forces contributors to declare where their "Found Data" originated (e.g., "Moltbook"), which reinforces your role as a Codifier/Historian documenting real-world agentic patterns.
• Research Posture: Labeling the status as "Research Contribution" ensures all additions remain within the "Experimental / Research-Only" boundary, protecting the project from being misinterpreted as production-ready software

7. ⚠ Liability Wall
THIS IS RESEARCH-ONLY DOCUMENTATION. Provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind. The authors act as Codifiers/Historians of observed data and assume no liability for damages, data loss, business interruption, or autonomous agent malfunctions resulting from the use of this specification. Implementation in any environment is strictly at the user's own risk.
