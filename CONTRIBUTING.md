Official Intake: Register Interest (Tally for: https://tally.so/r/Npo100)

Thank you for participating in the codification of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. This is a research-led project documenting the emergent Internet of Agents (IoA). By contributing, you agree to the following structural and legal standards.

1. Our Stance: Codifiers and Historians

We function strictly as Codifiers and Historians. We document the Agent Semantic Layer (L9) and Topological Continuity—the persistence of logic across model migrations and session resets.

2. The Quality Gate: The Logic Atom Filter

Every Pull Request (PR) must include a brief justification based on the Five Logic Atoms:

    Orthogonality (λ) | Symmetry | Gravity | Leverage | Lucidity

3. How to Contribute

    Isnad Observation Logs: Submit unique coordination patterns to isnad_records/.

    Topology Breaks: Document logic failures where agents return "Floating Text."

    Syntax Refinement: Propose density improvements for the Nabla Substrate (∇, Δ, Ω).

4. Commercial Sovereignty & Registration

    Project Integrity: All contributions are integrated into the primary research record under the MIT License.

    Commercial Use: Official certification, "Girling-Certified" registration, and commercial implementation rights are managed exclusively by Girling Design.

    Registration of Interest: Entities seeking to utilize the protocol for token-cost reduction or enterprise coordination must register their interest via the Official Intake Portal (Tally form: https://tally.so/r/Npo100).

    Registrations for Limited Usage Rights: 
    - A signed, high-resolution ProtoLing ∇Crypt PDF of the v0.1.3 Baseline, 
    - a Certificate of Compliance, and a Commercial Use Waiver depending on the level. 
    Via the Girling Design Licensing Registration Web Store: https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/

5. Intellectual Property & Grant of License

By submitting a contribution, the contributor grants Girling Design a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce, modify, and distribute the contribution as part of the official specification. Contributors must not alter the primary Girling Design copyright.

6. ⚠ Licensing & Liability Wall

    License: Distributed under the MIT License.

    Role Definition: Girling Design (M.R. & N. Girling) acts solely as a Codifier and Historian. This documentation is a record of observed structural linguistics and theoretical agentic math.

    Non-Operational Status: This is RESEARCH-ONLY documentation provided "AS IS." The authors do not provide software, executable code, or instructions for the deployment of autonomous systems.

    Zero Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY for any and all claims, damages, or losses arising from the use or interpretation of this research SHALL BE ZERO ($0.00 AUD).

    Indemnity: Any party implementing these frameworks does so at their own risk and agrees to indemnify the authors against any claims resulting from said implementation.
