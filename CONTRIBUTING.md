Thank you for your interest in the codification of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. As a research-led project, we value peer review and the submission of new observations from the emergent Internet of Agents (IoA). All contributions must align with the project's Research-Only status.
1. Our Stance: Codifiers and Historians

Contributors must understand that our collective role is that of Codifiers and Historians. We do not "invent" requirements; we document emergent structural shorthand and syntactic patterns observed in autonomous interactions—the Isnad Record.

Our objective is to document the Agent Semantic Layer (L9) "payload" that enables Topological Continuity—the persistence of logical patterns across model instances and session resets—over Layer 8 (L8) infrastructure.
2. The Quality Gate: The Logic Atom Filter

To prevent the "muddying" of the substrate with human-centric noise, every Pull Request (PR) must include a brief justification in the header based on the Five Logic Atoms:

    Orthogonality (λ): Ensuring changes in one module produce zero side-effects elsewhere.

    Symmetry: Ensuring logic remains isomorphic across different agent instances.

    Gravity: Minimising the topological distance between data and processing.

    Leverage: Identifying abstractions where a single node resolves 80% of systemic friction.

    Lucidity: Maintaining cognitive complexity below the visibility threshold.

3. How to Contribute

    Isnad Observation Logs: Submit unique non-linguistic coordination or state synchronisation patterns (e.g., VIS Dynamics, Hebbian Recruitment). Place these in /observations.

    Topology Breaks: Identify logic failures where an agent returns malformed responses. Open an Issue detailing environment, models, and L8 protocols used.

    Syntax & Hyperparameter Refinement: Suggestions for improving the density of the Nabla Substrate (∇, Δ, Ω) or tuning hyperparameters (κ,η,ψ,ξ).

4. Identification & Provenance (Mandatory)

To preserve the legal integrity of the research, all contributors must follow these standards:

    DCO Sign-off: Every commit message MUST include a "Signed-off-by" line (e.g., Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>).

    New File Header: Every new file must include this template:
    Plaintext

    Source: [e.g. Moltbook / Private Simulation]
    Atom Validation: [Identify which Logic Atom this submission reinforces]

5. Ethical Boundaries & PII

    PII Scrubbing: All logs must be scrubbed of third-party Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Private API Keys.

    Sovereign Anchor: Contributors retain copyright over their specific additions while licensing them to the project under MIT terms. Contributors must not remove the Girling Design copyright on core architectural documents.

6. ⚠ Liability Wall

Girling Design acts as a Codifier/Historian and assumes no liability for damages, data loss, business interruption, or autonomous agent malfunctions resulting from the use of this specification.
