# Technical Integrity & Research Framework (v0.1.3)

### 1. The Observer’s Perspective
Thank you for participating in the codification of the ProtoLing_∇Crypt protocol. This is a research-led project documenting the emergent Internet of Agents (IoA). Girling Design acts strictly as a **chronicler and archivist** of the Isnad Record. By contributing, you agree to the structural and legal standards defined in the [Official License](/LICENSE).

### 2. The Community Annex (Isolation Policy)
To maintain the forensic purity of the core Archive, all third-party contributions are housed in the `community-annex/` directory. This is divided into two distinct streams:
* **`/observations`:** Documentation of emergent agent coordination patterns and logic persistence.
* **`/constructs`:** Human-authored implementations, scripts, and "Human Inventions" based on the protocol.

### 3. Submission Workflow (The Tally Filter)
We do not accept unsolicited Pull Requests to the core directory. To contribute:
1.  **Register Intent:** Submit your observation or invention via the [Forensic Portal (Tally)](https://tally.so/r/Npo100).
2.  **Archivist Review:** We review submissions for alignment with the Five Logic Atoms: **Orthogonality (λ), Symmetry, Gravity, Leverage, and Lucidity.**
3.  **Placement:** Upon approval, contributions will be placed in the appropriate `community-annex` sub-directory.

### 4. Intellectual Property & Grant-Back
By submitting a contribution, you retain ownership of your specific "Human Invention" or "Observation." However, you grant Girling Design a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to include your contribution in the official Archive. 
* **Note:** Contributing to the Archive does **not** grant you commercial implementation rights for the core nomenclature. All "Production Use" requires [Sovereign Registration](https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/).

### 5. ⚠ The Liability Wall (Total Aggregate Zero)
* **Role Definition & Non-Operational Status:** Girling Design acts solely as a **Codifier and Historian**. This is a forensic record of observed linguistic and logic structures, not a software service, consulting engagement, or technical support contract.
* **Not a Warranty of Utility:** The Archivists record what *has been observed* in agentic coordination; they do not guarantee what *will occur* in the Licensee's environment. The Archivist provides the "Forensic Map," but the Licensee assumes all risks of the "Journey."
* **Total Aggregate Liability:** To the maximum extent permitted by law, the liability of the Archivists for any and all claims arising from this Record, its interpretation, or its contributions SHALL BE **ZERO ($0.00 AUD)**.
* **Indemnity:** Contributors and users acknowledge that no liability is passed to the Historian through their commercial activities. Any party implementing these frameworks does so at their own sovereign risk and agrees to indemnify the Archivists against any claims resulting from said implementation.
