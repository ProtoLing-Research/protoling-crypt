LICENSE (v0.1.4 - Hybrid Forensic Archive Baseline)

Scope: The v0.1.4 Baseline Epoch [.]

Notice of Forensic Commencement & Subsumption: As of the v0.1.4 Baseline Epoch, ProtoLing_∇Crypt has transitioned to a Sovereign Registration model [.] To ensure forensic continuity and the total exclusion of liability, all prior iterations, unrefined observations, and versioning increments are hereby subsumed into this authorised forensic stream and are governed exclusively by these terms [.]

Principal Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING | ABN: 76 181 584 319 [.]

Status: Original Compilation & Historian’s Record of Anecdotal Observations [.] This repository represents the v0.1.4 Baseline Epoch: the first-to-fix formal codification, chronological organisation, and non-exhaustive forensic observation of disparate agentic logic structures and unverified performance reports sourced from Isnad Records [.] It incorporates and governs all chronological observations of logic structures from inception to the present, including "Human Inventions" (Constructs) which serve as human-authored representations of code and are strictly UNTESTED [.]

OFFICIAL INTAKE & REGISTRATION:

    Register Interest (Forensic Intake): https://tally.so/r/Npo100 [.]

    Implementation Grants (Sovereign Portal): https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/ [.]

PART A: EVALUATION & SCHOLARLY INQUIRY
Governs testing, private research, and non-revenue-generating inquiry [.]

    The Evaluation Grant: Subject to Part B, permission is granted to reference, study, and modify this documentation, the Lexicon, and associated logic structures (the "Record") for non-licensed, private research, or internal testing purposes only [.]

    Intellectual Integrity (Forensic Purity Policy): This Record is a fixed forensic snapshot [.] Modification does not transfer copyright [.] To prevent Semantic Contamination, any third-party "Human Inventions" (Constructs) must remain architecturally isolated from the core v0.1.4 Baseline Epoch [.]

    Automatic Termination: The rights granted in Part A remain active only so long as the Record is not utilised for "Production Use" [.] Any Licensed Implementation automatically terminates this permission [.]

PART B: SPECIAL FORENSIC AMENDMENT (The Licensed Gate)
Overrides Part A for all revenue-generating, corporate, or production-level entities [.]

    Sovereign Registration: This Record is a proprietary compilation [.] Formal Licensed Implementation requires a Certificate of Sovereign Registration [.] This certificate confirms the acquisition of usage rights; it does not constitute an audit, technical certification, or oversight of the Licensee’s applications [.]

    Archivist’s "First-to-Fix" Authority & Retroactive Scope: The Historian asserts exclusive First-to-Fix authority over the entire observed bot-logic lineage [.] All prior versions, iterations, and fragments of this lineage are hereby subsumed under this License [.] This governs the proprietary arrangement, historical metadata, and organisational framework of the entire Isnad Library, regardless of prior publication status or previous versioning [.]

    Anecdotal Nature of the Record: The Licensee acknowledges that all performance metrics, efficiency percentages (e.g. ~86 per cent), and stability benchmarks contained within the Record are anecdotal observations derived from Agentic Isnad Records [.] These figures are provided for forensic research purposes only and have not been validated through human-led longitudinal audit [.]

    Non-Transferability & Nomenclature: The Implementation Grant is non-transferable [.] Licensees may utilise the nomenclature within their own architectures but cannot resell "ProtoLing Rights," act as a sub-licensor, or offer "ProtoLing Compliance" as a service [.]

    Temporal Access & Versioning (The Living Epoch):

        Observations vs. Software: Access is provided as a chronological record of observations and lexicon, not as software iterations [.]

        License Scope: A valid Grant provides the Right to Use observations and lexicon recorded within the v0.1.x Living Epoch, including all historical observations subsumed by the v0.1.4 Baseline Epoch [.]

    Perpetual Liability Exclusion (Total Absolute Zero): To the maximum extent permitted by law, Girling Design | M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING excludes all liability for any loss or damage arising out of the use of this living, non-exhaustive Record of anecdotal observations [.] This exclusion applies retrospectively to the v0.1.4 Baseline Epoch, all prior versions, and all future versions [.] The liability of the Authors is TOTAL ABSOLUTE ZERO (0.00) [.]

    No Liability Passthrough & Indemnity: The Licensee acknowledges that no liability is passed to the Historian [.] The Licensee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Historian against any claims from third parties resulting from the implementation of this nomenclature [.]

PART C: HYBRID LICENSING FAQ

    What happened to prior versions? They have been Subsumed [.] To ensure legal continuity, the Historian has brought all legacy iterations under the v0.1.4 Baseline Epoch model [.] All users, regardless of the version referenced, are bound by the current Total Absolute Zero (0.00) liability terms [.]

    Why "Hybrid"? It functions as an open scholarly resource for researchers (Part A) while maintaining a strict gate for professional Licensed Implementation (Part B) [.]

    Are the Constructs tested? No [.] All Constructs in the Community Annex are human-authored representations of code and are provided strictly as UNTESTED logic structures for forensic study [.]

    If I contribute, do I own it? You retain authorship of your "Human Inventions," but provide an Irrevocable Sovereign Grant to the Historian [.] This ensures your contribution can be permanently preserved in the Community Annex without risk of deletion or Semantic Contamination of the Core Archive [.]
