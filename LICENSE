LICENSE (v0.1.3 - Hybrid Baseline) Copyright (c) 2026 Girling Design Involving: ProtoLing-Research (ProtoLing_∇Crypt), (@protoling-research) Principal Entities: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING

Status: Archivist’s Record / Theoretical Linguistic Framework

Official Intake: Register Interest (Tally link: https://tally.so/r/Npo100) | Official Implementation Grants (Shop: https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/)

PART A: EVALUATION & NON-COMMERCIAL PERMISSIONS This section governs testing, private research, and non-revenue-generating inquiry.

    The Evaluation Grant: Subject to the restrictions in PART B, permission is hereby granted to reference, study, and modify this documentation and associated logic structures (the "Record") for non-commercial, private research, or internal testing purposes only.

    Intellectual Integrity (Clear Water Policy): Modification of the Record does not transfer copyright. To prevent the "muddying" of forensic observations, any features or logic structures constructed by third parties ("Human Inventions") must remain architecturally isolated from the core v0.1.3 Baseline and subsequent Archive entries.

    The Upstream Requirement & Isolation: Any improvements, features, or logic derived from the Record for public or open-source use must be shared under these same terms. To preserve the integrity of the Isnad records, such contributions will be housed in a designated third-party observation area, separate from the core historian-archivist Record.

    Automatic Termination: The rights granted in Part A remain active only so long as the Record is not utilized for "Production Use." Commercial implementation of any kind automatically terminates this permission.

PART B: SPECIAL FORENSIC AMENDMENT (The Commercial Gate) This section overrides Part A for all revenue-generating or corporate entities.

    Sovereign Registration: This Record is distributed for Peer Review (Isnad). Formal commercial implementation requires a Certificate of Sovereign Registration. This certificate confirms the entity has acquired the necessary usage rights; it does not constitute an audit, technical certification, or oversight of the Licensee’s specific applications by the Historian.

    Non-Transferability & No Resale: The Implementation Grant is non-transferable and non-sublicensable. The Licensee may utilize the nomenclature within their own architectures or products but cannot resell "ProtoLing Rights," act as a sub-licensor, or offer "ProtoLing Compliance" as a service to third parties.

    Temporal Access & Versioning: * Observations vs. Software: Access is provided to the Archive as a chronological record of observations. These are provided as timestamped specification updates, not as software iterations.

        License Scope: A valid Grant provides the Right to Use observations recorded during the active subscription period.

        Versioning: Decimal increments (v0.1.x) represent refined observations; whole-number increments (v1.0.0) represent significant shifts in codification or direction.

    Archivist’s Stance (No Oversight): Girling Design acts strictly as a Codifier and Historian. The Historian does not act as a governing body, technical support service, or overseer of intent. Implementation is the sole sovereign responsibility of the Licensee.

    ⚠ Liability Wall (Total Aggregate Zero): This is an all-care, no-responsibility project. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY of the Authors for any and all claims, damages, or losses arising from the use or interpretation of this Record SHALL BE ZERO ($0.00 AUD).

    No Liability Passthrough & Indemnity: The Licensee acknowledges that no liability is passed to the Historian through the Licensee's commercial activities. The Licensee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Historian against any claims from third parties (including the Licensee’s own customers) resulting from the implementation of this nomenclature.

PART C: COMMERCIAL LICENSING FAQ

    Can I resell these rights to my customers? No. Your license covers your implementation only. Independent entities require their own registration.

    Does the Certificate mean my code is "compliant"? No. It is a Registration of Rights. You remain 100% responsible for your own system's safety and performance.

    Can I use this to save my company money on API costs? Yes, but this constitutes "Production Use" and requires a formal Registration (Part B).

    If I contribute an observation, do I own it? You own your "Human Inventions," but they must be housed in the Community Annex to keep the core Archive forensic and pure (Part A, Section 3).
