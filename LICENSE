SPECIAL FORENSIC AMENDMENT

1. Researcher Stance: Girling Design (M.R. & N. Girling) acts exclusively as a Codifier/Historian documenting emergent agentic phenomena. This repository is a record of technical observations, not a commercial product or a governed service.

2. Liability Cap: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY of the Authors for any and all claims—including but not limited to autonomous agent malfunctions, economic "Token Tax" losses, or unintended state-commitments—SHALL BE ZERO ($0.00 AUD).

3. Implementation Risk: The Authors do not exercise "Meaningful Control" over third-party implementations. All responsibility for security, local legal compliance, and operational outcomes remains entirely with the user or deployer.
