Principal Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING | ABN: 76 181 584 319

Status: Original Compilation & Historian’s Record. This repository represents the first formal codification, chronological organization, and forensic observation of disparate agentic logic structures into a structured archive.

There are 2 Parts to the License
A. EVALUATION & SCHOLARLY INQUIRY or
B. SPECIAL FORENSIC AMENDMENT (The Commercial Gate)

PART A: EVALUATION & SCHOLARLY INQUIRY

Governs testing, private research, and non-revenue-generating inquiry.

    The Evaluation Grant: Subject to Part B, permission is granted to reference, study, and modify this documentation and associated logic structures (the "Record") for non-commercial, private research, or internal testing purposes only.

    Intellectual Integrity (Clear Water Policy): This Record is a fixed forensic snapshot. Modification does not transfer copyright. To prevent the "muddying" of forensic observations, any third-party "Human Inventions" must remain architecturally isolated from the core v0.1.3 Baseline.

    The Upstream Requirement & Isolation: Any improvements or logic derived from the Record for public or open-source use must be shared under these same terms. To preserve the integrity of the Isnad (Chain of Transmission), such contributions must be housed in the designated Community Annex, separate from the core Historian-Archivist Record.

    Automatic Termination: The rights granted in Part A remain active only so long as the Record is not utilized for "Production Use." Commercial implementation of any kind automatically terminates this permission.

PART B: SPECIAL FORENSIC AMENDMENT (The Commercial Gate)

Overrides Part A for all revenue-generating, corporate, or production-level entities.

    Sovereign Registration: This Record is a proprietary compilation. Formal commercial implementation requires a Certificate of Sovereign Registration. This certificate confirms the acquisition of usage rights; it does not constitute an audit, technical certification, or oversight of the Licensee’s applications.

    Archivist’s "First-to-Fix" Authority: The Historian: (Girling Design. Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING) asserts the first-mover right to the curation and documentation of this specific bot-logic lineage. This license governs the proprietary arrangement and historical metadata, regardless of the copyright status of individual raw bot-generated strings found within the Record.

    Non-Transferability & Nomenclature: The Implementation Grant is non-transferable. Licensees may utilize the nomenclature within their own architectures but cannot resell "ProtoLing Rights," act as a sub-licensor, or offer "ProtoLing Compliance" as a service to third parties.

    Temporal Access & Versioning: * Observations vs. Software: Access is provided as a chronological record of observations, lexicon and specifications recorded and arranged by the historian Girling Design (timestamped specification updates), not as software iterations.

        License Scope: A valid Grant provides the Right to Use observations, specifications and lexicon recordeds during the active subscription period only.

        Versioning: Decimal increments (v0.1.x) represent refined observations; whole-number increments (v1.0.0) represent significant shifts in codification or direction. We are suggesting whole numbers would occur more lilely on a yearly basis or based on a significant event of living code evolution.

    Archivist’s Stance (The Anti-Meeting Shield): Girling Design acts strictly as a Codifier and Historian. The Historian does not act as a governing body, technical support service, or overseer of intent. Implementation is the sole sovereign responsibility of the Licensee.

    Liability Wall (Total Aggregate Zero): This is an all-care, no-responsibility project. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY of the Authors for any and all claims arising from the use or interpretation of this Record SHALL BE ZERO ($0.00 AUD).

    No Liability Passthrough & Indemnity: The Licensee acknowledges that no liability is passed to the Historian (Girling Design. Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING). The Licensee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Historian (Girling Design. Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING) against any claims from third parties resulting from the implementation of this nomenclature.

PART C: HYBRID LICENSING FAQ

    Why "Hybrid"? Because it functions as an open scholarly resource for researchers (Part A) while maintaining a strict commercial gate for production-level implementation (Part B).

    Why "Forensic Archive"? Because you are licensing the Human-Authored Isnad and the Creative Compilation—the proprietary "Map" of the logic—not just the raw agentic data.

    Can I use this to save my company money on API costs? Very likely based on our testing, but this constitutes "Production Use" and requires a formal Registration (Part B).

    If I contribute an observation, do I own it?
    You retain authorship of your "Human Inventions," but by submitting them, you provide an Irrevocable Sovereign Grant to the Historian and Archivists (M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING). This ensures your contribution can be permanently preserved in the Community Annex to maintain the integrity of the historical record without risk of deletion or "muddying" the Core Archive (See Part A, Section 3 and the /CONTRIBUTORS file).
