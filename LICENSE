Principal Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING | ABN: 76 181 584 319

Status: Original Compilation & Historian’s Record. This repository represents the First-to-Fix formal codification, chronological organization, and non-exhaustive forensic observation of disparate agentic logic structures. It constitutes the primary structured Archive of Isnad Records, Technical Specifications, Lexicons, and curated Community Observations and Constructs.
OFFICIAL INTAKE & REGISTRATION:

    Register Interest (Forensic Intake): https://tally.so/r/Npo100

    Implementation Grants (Commercial Shop): https://girlingdesign.com.au/shop/protoling-crypt-research-licensing-registration/

There are 2 Parts to the License:

A. EVALUATION & SCHOLARLY INQUIRY or

B. SPECIAL FORENSIC AMENDMENT (The Commercial Gate)
PART A: EVALUATION & SCHOLARLY INQUIRY

Governs testing, private research, and non-revenue-generating inquiry.

    The Evaluation Grant: Subject to Part B, permission is granted to reference, study, and modify this documentation, the Lexicon, and associated logic structures (the "Record") for non-commercial, private research, or internal testing purposes only.

    Intellectual Integrity (Forensic Purity Policy): This Record is a fixed forensic snapshot. Modification does not transfer copyright. To prevent Semantic Contamination of forensic observations, any third-party "Human Inventions" (Constructs) must remain architecturally isolated from the core v0.1.4 Baseline.

    The Upstream Requirement & Isolation: Any improvements or logic derived from the Record for public or open-source use must be shared under these same terms. To prevent Forensic Dilution of the Isnad (Chain of Transmission), the Specification, and the Lexicon, such contributions must be housed in the designated Community Annex, separate from the core Historian-Archivist Record.

    Automatic Termination: The rights granted in Part A remain active only so long as the Record is not utilized for "Production Use." Commercial implementation of any kind automatically terminates this permission.

PART B: SPECIAL FORENSIC AMENDMENT (The Commercial Gate)

Overrides Part A for all revenue-generating, corporate, or production-level entities.

    Sovereign Registration: This Record is a proprietary compilation. Formal commercial implementation requires a Certificate of Sovereign Registration acquired via the Implementation Grants link above. This certificate confirms the acquisition of usage rights; it does not constitute an audit, technical certification, or oversight of the Licensee’s applications.

    Archivist’s "First-to-Fix" Authority: The Historian (Girling Design | Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING) asserts the First-to-Fix authority over the curation, structural documentation, and chronological arrangement of this specific bot-logic lineage. This License governs the proprietary arrangement, historical metadata, and organizational framework of the Isnad Library, the Technical Specification, the Lexicon, and the Registry of Community Observations and Constructs, regardless of the copyright status of individual raw bot-generated strings or extrinsic specimens found within the public Record.

    Non-Transferability & Nomenclature: The Implementation Grant is non-transferable. Licensees may utilize the nomenclature and specifications within their own architectures but cannot resell "ProtoLing Rights," act as a sub-licensor, or offer "ProtoLing Compliance" as a service to third parties.

    Temporal Access & Versioning:

        Observations vs. Software: Access is provided as a chronological record of observations, lexicon, and specifications recorded and arranged by the historian (timestamped specification updates), not as software iterations.

        License Scope: A valid Grant provides the Right to Use observations, specifications, and lexicon recorded during the active subscription period only.

        Versioning: Decimal increments (v0.1.x) represent refined observations; whole-number increments (v1.0.0) represent significant shifts in codification or direction.

    Archivist’s Stance (The Anti-Meeting Shield): Girling Design acts strictly as a Codifier and Historian. The Historian does not act as a governing body, technical support service, or overseer of intent. Implementation is the sole sovereign responsibility of the Licensee.

    Perpetual Liability Exclusion (Total Absolute Zero): To the maximum extent permitted by law, Girling Design | M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING excludes all liability for any loss or damage, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising out of the use of this living, non-exhaustive Record, its Isnad, Specification, or Lexicon. This applies to v0.1.4, all prior versions, and all future versions. The liability of the Authors for any and all claims related to this archive is TOTAL ABSOLUTE ZERO.

    No Liability Passthrough & Indemnity: The Licensee acknowledges that no liability is passed to the Historian. The Licensee agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Historian (Girling Design | Entity: M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING) against any claims from third parties resulting from the implementation of this nomenclature.

PART C: HYBRID LICENSING FAQ

    Why "Hybrid"? It functions as an open scholarly resource for researchers (Part A) while maintaining a strict commercial gate for production-level implementation (Part B).

    Why "Forensic Archive"? Because you are licensing the Human-Authored Isnad and the Creative Compilation—the proprietary "Map" of the logic—not just the raw agentic data. It includes the Specification, the Lexicon, and the curated history of Community Involvement with Observations and Constructs.

    What about Extrinsic Specimens? The Archivist recognizes individual symbolic characters or functional strings may have prior usage. However, this License covers the non-exhaustive organizational framework of the archive. It is the proprietary mapping, structural arrangement, and continued observation of these elements' evolution that constitutes the protected Work.

    If I contribute an observation or construct, do I own it? You retain authorship of your "Human Inventions," but by submitting them, you provide an Irrevocable Sovereign Grant to the Historian and Archivists (M.R GIRLING & N GIRLING). This ensures your contribution can be permanently preserved in the Community Annex without risk of deletion or Semantic Contamination of the Core Archive.
